# QPERF-GO

A performance measurement tool for QUIC ([RFC9000](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000)) similar to iperf.
Uses https://github.com/birneee/quic-go

## Features

- send and receive streams
- send and receive datagrams ([RFC9221](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9221))
- qlog output ([draft-ietf-quic-qlog](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema/))
- 0-RTT handshakes
- CPU profiling
- experimental XADS-QUIC extension (TBD)

## Example
```bash
$ ./qperf-go client -a localhost -xads

```

## Requirements
- Go 1.20

## Build
```bash
go build
```

## Setup
It is recommended to increase the maximum buffer size by running (See https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Receive-Buffer-Size for details):

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2500000
```
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2500000
```
## Generate Self-signed certificate
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 358000 -out server.crt -keyout server.key -config server.req
```
